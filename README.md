# Robot tests

Robot framework tests for webshop.

Resources:
- http://robotframework.org/
- https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework
- https://github.com/robotframework/SeleniumLibrary

### Installation
Prerequisites, python python-pip, web browser (Firefox or Chrome, IE with limited functionality.)

Basically you want to follow the installation instructions at the [SeleniumLibrary github pages](https://github.com/robotframework/SeleniumLibrary), since that will install the latest version of the RobotFramework as a dependency.
```
pip install robotframework-seleniumlibrary
```

Plain Robot Framework installation can be performed by issuing
```
pip install robotframework
```
However, SeleniumLibrary will bring a lot of additional functionality needed with the tests.
